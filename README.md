# Differential diagnosis of Mendelian disease using hyperbolic graph representation learning
This repository contains the $\LaTeX$ code used to write this Master thesis. For an updated rendered pdf version refer to the latest [release](https://github.com/LuciaMellini/masterThesis/releases/tag/latest).

## Additional material
The code used to build the integrated knowledge graph described in Section 5.1 can be consulted in the [PatientKG repository](https://github.com/LuciaMellini/PatientKG).
The changes applied to the preexisting implementation of HGCN are contained in the forked hgcn repository. Specifically, the master branch adds mini-batching for the training process and subsequent inference learning to allow validation.
