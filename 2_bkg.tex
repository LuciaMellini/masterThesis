% By integrating diverse data sources, BKGs enable more
% comprehensive representation and analysis of biomedical knowledge [4, 5]. This structured
% integration facilitates advanced applications such as disease modeling, drug discovery, and
% personalized medicine in ways that traditional approaches cannot easily support. Recent
% advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models (LLMs) [6]
% and multi-modal data integration [7], have significantly enhanced the development and utility
% of BKGs. Techniques such as graph representation learning and natural language processing
% have expanded the scope and impact of BKG applications, generating novel insights into
% disease mechanisms and accelerating drug development efforts.
